## swirlcamp: swirl inside DataCamp

This small R package is a wrapper around the [adapted swirl package](http://www.github.com/Data-Camp/swirl) that provides a S3 implementations that override the typical swirl behavior. These alternative implementations of some of swirl's functions will enable the power of swirl in the DataCamp RStudio learning interface.
